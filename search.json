It provides an overview of electricity capacity, generation, consumption, and price trends from 2011 to 2021. A comprehensive report highlighting these trends has not been produced for the state of Alaska since 2013’s Alaska Energy Statistics Report.\nThis web book is designed as ‘best available’ document for the 2011-2021 energy trends data and reports. This website will be updated when updates to the underlying 2011-2021 data or fixes become available. Future year trends reports will be tackled in a different context and reporting structure.\nPlease explore the data using the chapter navigation links in the left sidebar and the section navigation links in the right sidebar.",

    "text": "Executive Summary\nThe objective of this work is to provide regulators, legislators, and other energy stakeholders with a holistic look at recent trends in electrical generation. The first impetus for this report is a lack of combined reporting on electricity generation across the state that extends to federally and non-federally regulated electric utilities (most of Alaska’s electric utilities do not meet the minimum threshold for federal reporting requirements). The second impetus for this report is to aid in decision-making processes surrounding Alaska’s energy future.\nWith uncertainty in natural gas sources on the Railbelt, technological advancements in generation technology, and improvements in the affordability of technologies, understanding trends in the state’s capacity, generation, consumption, and prices is vital to more informed decision-making.\nIn this report, we present data collected from federal, state, and local sources supplemented by correspondence with utilities. We show trends for capacity, generation, consumption, and prices. The capacity and generation trends include data from 2011 to 2021, and the consumption and prices trends are data limited to 2019. More information on sources and methods are provided in the subsequent sections throughout the report. This report uses data visualizations as the primary mode for presenting the trends. To accommodate this presentation style, we present trends as simplified regions of the state as opposed to the Alaska Energy Authority energy regions.\nWe emphasize that this report is designed to provide factual information to the best of our ability without providing recommendations or in-depth analysis. However, context is provided for more impactful trends.",

    "text": "4.1 General Overview\nUtilities in Alaska serve multiple customers, namely residential, commercial, industrial, government/municipal, and community customer classes. Each customer class experiences a different set of costs such as per kWh charge as well as monthly customer charges. In this section, we aim to highlight trends in electricity prices for the residential, commercial, and other customer classes across the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. We again restrict the data years in this section to 2011 to 2019 due to concerns with data validity for 2020-21.\nIn rural areas, many communities are eligible to participate in the PCE program (described in ?sec-pce-description). It is important to note that the prices presented here reflect the post-PCE adjustment and are annualized averages based on the calendar year. Yearly average effective rates listed here reflect the calendar year and not the fiscal year, which will make them different from those reported in the AEA’s annual reports. We also note that for PCE communities, the rates are reported in the original data. For data sourced from the EIA, rates were calculated by dividing total revenue by total kWh sold in each customer class - this may overestimate the rate as this would include revenue from customer charges.\nNote that all prices in this section have been adjusted for inflation over time to 2021 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items in urban Alaska (BLS CUUSA427SA0). To our knowledge, there is no CPI that properly accounts for price changes over time in rural Alaska. However, the general trend shows that customer account-weighted prices have been relatively stagnant across all regions of the state.",

Hover your pointer over the dot to display utility information.\nMost notably, the dramatic effects of the PCE subsidy can be seen by comparing the price distribution of the residential customer class against the price distribution of the commercial/other customer classes in the Rural Remote and Coastal regions.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Regional Averages\nDue to the wide range of electricity prices in Alaska, it is difficult to accurately summarize the data. Because of this, we determined that averages were best calculated using a customer account weighted average. Population is roughly correlated to price, with small communities experiencing higher rates than larger communities. The average number of customer accounts for the year was used to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean price for each year and region. ?fig-price-over-time is a graph of residential customer prices over time after weighting for the number of customer accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"HTML code block active\"",

During this time, the Alaska Power Administration was a federal agency housed within the U.S. Department of the Interior. Their first publication was known as the “First Annual Report” and covered data from the 1968 fiscal year. However, this became the “Alaska Electric Power Statistics Report” in 1971 and examined data from the 1960-1969 data years. The APA continued to produce intermittent reports until 1983 when the State of Alaska established the Alaska Power Authority (APA), which later became the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA).\nUnder state direction, the APA/AEA continued to publish intermittent reports on electric power statistics until their final publication in 1992 which covered data years 1960 to 1991. To address the reporting gap, the Alaska Systems Coordinating Council in collaboration with the State of Alaska, Department of Community and Regional Affairs, Division of Energy continued generating reports until 1996 with their final report covering data years 1960 to 1995. Finally, the University of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research produced several reports with their last covering 1960 to 2012. Since then, there have been no electric power statistical reports.\nThe Table A.1 provides a summary of this timeline. This report serves to supplement the reporting gap in electric power statistics for the State of Alaska.\n\n\n\nTable A.1: Historical Timeline of Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Published\nInstitution\nData Coverage\n\n\n\n\n1971 to 1983\nAlaska Power Administration\n1960 to 1982\n\n\n1984 to 1988\nAlaska Power Authority\n1960 to 1987\n\n\n1989 to 1992\nAlaska Energy Authority\n1960 to 1991\n\n\n1992 to 1996\nAlaska Systems Coordinating Council; State of Alaska\n1960 to 1995\n\n\n2003, 2011 to 2015\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research\n1960 to 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a table of links to these historic reports, please refer to ?tbl-historic-reports.",

Code can be rendered into many formats, such as articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books.\nThe data team at ACEP has explored rendering to HTML and to PDF formats in order to build interactive websites and print publications.\nDespite Quarto’s powers, QMD files that generate Javascript and HTML won’t render to PDF. In some cases, the render will throw an error. In order to maintain a code base that builds both an interactive website and a PDF document, we utilize seperate code blocks and conditional rendering. Effectively, code blocks are turned on or off depending on the target output. This is done in the chunk header.\n If you’d like the chunk to run when building a website, use:  {r, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}  If you’d like the chunk to run when building a PDF, use:  {r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output()}",

By conditionally evaluating using the header code from above, we can build a website and static report from the same code base.\nYou will only see one graph no matter what the render format because the other is conditionally executed for the other format.
