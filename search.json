    "text": "2.1 General Overview\nUtilities in Alaska serve multiple customers, namely residential, commercial, industrial, government/municipal, and community customer classes. Each customer class experiences a different set of costs such as per kWh charge as well as monthly customer charges. In this section, we aim to highlight trends in electricity prices for the residential, commercial, and other customer classes across the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. We again restrict the data years in this section to 2011 to 2019 due to concerns with data validity for 2020-21.\nIn rural areas, many communities are eligible to participate in the PCE program (described in ?sec-pce-description). It is important to note that the prices presented here reflect the post-PCE adjustment and are annualized averages based on the calendar year. Yearly average effective rates listed here reflect the calendar year and not the fiscal year, which will make them different from those reported in the AEA’s annual reports. We also note that for PCE communities, the rates are reported in the original data. For data sourced from the EIA, rates were calculated by dividing total revenue by total kWh sold in each customer class - this may overestimate the rate as this would include revenue from customer charges.\nNote that all prices in this section have been adjusted for inflation over time to 2021 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items in urban Alaska (BLS CUUSA427SA0). To our knowledge, there is no CPI that properly accounts for price changes over time in rural Alaska. However, the general trend shows that customer account-weighted prices have been relatively stagnant across all regions of the state.",

The three classes used in this analysis can be selected from the dropdown menu. Hover your pointer over the dot to display utility information.\nMost notably, the dramatic effects of the PCE subsidy can be seen by comparing the price distribution of the residential customer class against the price distribution of the commercial/other customer classes in the Rural Remote and Coastal regions.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Regional Averages\nDue to the wide range of electricity prices in Alaska, it is difficult to accurately summarize the data. Because of this, we determined that averages were best calculated using a customer account weighted average. Population is roughly correlated to price, with small communities experiencing higher rates than larger communities. The average number of customer accounts for the year was used to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean price for each year and region. ?fig-price-over-time is a graph of residential customer prices over time after weighting for the number of customer accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"HTML code block active\"",

Similar to npm, renv is globally installed on your system independent of the repo environment.\nOnce the repository has been cloned to your computer and renv is installed on your system, install the necessary R dependencies:\n1. In a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the repo\n2. Start R by typing R and pressing Enter\n3. In the resulting R console, run the following command\nrenv::restore() #installs packages in the `renv.lock` file  \nAs you write code that needs additional packages, include them at the top of your scripts as library(\"new-package\"). Then, before committing, run steps 1 through 3 above, but use renv::snapshot() in step 3. This will comb through the repo to look for packages not in the renv.lock file. When you are prompted for a selection, select option 2: \"Install the packages, then snapshot\" to bring the new packages into the fold.\nNote: To get you started, the renv.lock file of this repo includes all tidyverse packages",

Code can be rendered into many formats, such as articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books.\nThe data team at ACEP has explored rendering to HTML and to PDF formats in order to build interactive websites and print publications.\nDespite Quarto’s powers, QMD files that generate Javascript and HTML won’t render to PDF. In some cases, the render will throw an error. In order to maintain a code base that builds both an interactive website and a PDF document, we utilize seperate code blocks and conditional rendering. Effectively, code blocks are turned on or off depending on the target output. This is done in the chunk header.\n If you’d like the chunk to run when building a website, use:  {r, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}  If you’d like the chunk to run when building a PDF, use:  {r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output()}",

Since the interative tooltip builds out as HTML and Javascript, it will break if Quarto is rendering a PDF.\nAnd so we have two chunks, one with interactivity that’s destined for the web, and the other is static for the PDF report. By including them side-by-side, the flow of the document is preserved. By conditionally evaluating using the header code from above, we can build a website and static report from the same code base.\nYou will only see one graph no matter what the render format because the other is conditionally executed for the other format. Look below the graph to see either “HTML code block active” or “PDF code block active” depending on the format you are viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"HTML code block active\"",
